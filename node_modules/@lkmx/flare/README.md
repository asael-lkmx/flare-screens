# Flare

Flare is a design system for agile front-end software engineering. 

Flare's paradigm helps to understand the user interface from a simple and structured standpoint, introducing an abstraction layer that shapes a common language between analysts, designers, coders and testers.

Flare separates the UX/UI design problem in four different axis with definitions but also strategies and technology to solve each one of them.

 - **Style**. A list of key-value pairs to resolve general aspects of the design:  traditionally space, colors, typography and digitally screen, forms and tables.
 - **Structure**. The main application component definitions: layout, page, frames, and block.
 - **UI**. A collection of components that use existing and new key-value pairs to solve for general aspects of the design,
   and that are compatible with the structure components.
 - **Content**. A collection of SSR/SSG components designed to read and parse content from markdown fully separating the concerns of content, design and behavior.
